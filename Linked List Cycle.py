LeetCode 141. Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

This is not the right way to do it, but it works for now ðŸ¤£.

It works becase there's an error when the reccursive depth is reached, an error is thrown.

This solution is very slow - faster than 5% - compared to others and could be Time Limit Exceeded in the future or in another platform maybe.
